# Figures


```{r, include = FALSE}
leanbuild::set_knitr_image_path()
```

## Make a plot

This is the same code as in chapter 2, but here we can show how setting `knitr` chunks helps us tidy stuff up.

```{r}
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
```


```{r}
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```
